   <h2 class="text-white">About me</h2>
   
  <p class="text-white">My name is Tiffany Chow, currently a Digital Media Art student at SJSU. 
  Living most of my life in Taiwan, growing up in a conservative environment,
  I have a pretty heavy Asian cultural mindset, where schoolwork was what I 
  only used to care about the most. However, when I was in middle school, 
  I came across a lot of movies, cartoons, and western media that made me 
  yearn for how fascinating that people put passion into the creative artwork that is not taught 
  in school and to embrace my love for art. Now, I am here eager to learn more about how to put
  my passion for art into actual skills. I always feel comfortable drawing traditional and digital art,
  doing video editing work, and playing video games. During the pandemic, I explored a lot of different
  media, and I am currently really passionate about Adobe After Effects to make simple GIFs.
  I am interested in many things, oftentimes I learn them by watching Youtube, and then I share 
  most of the work on Twitter(@glaucousblue) and Tumblr @pinkongrey). I always feel accomplished
  by doing the artwork myself. When learning the After Effects, I start from figuring out how the
  programs work, then spending three days doing a piece of editing work and finally finishing an 
  edit faster, in around two hours of work time now. The learning process is one of my favorites, 
  it let me understand the things I never explored, experience the different and unexpected things 
  that can happen while working on a project. For example, my failure in coding leads me to find 
  other programs to use, or I can use it as a glitch, a little pleasant surprise for my works.
  Most of the work is created with Sony Vegas, After Effects, Clip Studio Paint, MediBang Paint Pro,
  and SAI. From school, I got more access to Adobe, which I found they have such impressive functions
  and features. And some of those are currently applied in our art works. This indeed makes me want to 
  learn more about Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator in the future. Currently, 
  I am in the game development club, and I grow a lot of interest in Unity. Even though
  I am not professional enough in coding or designing games but our teamwork shows me a lot of amazing, 
  creative works from other classmates. I understand more about coding because I am their artist.
  Group work in game design really inspired more of my creative ideas and hope someday I can host
  one of those projects and create my own game someday. As a person who is not good at using language
  to express myself properly, art is always what I hold on to the most. I wish to create captivating 
  projects to express my ideas through my artwork. SJSU has provided the perfect program of combing
  digital media art into their course, It is really an Integration process and I wish to integrate
  more skill sets and technology into my work of art. Now, I am here eager to learn more about how 
  to put my passion for art into actual skills.   </p>
